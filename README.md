# Monet-CycleGAN

# 1. Problem description

The Kaggle competition titled "I’m Something of a Painter Myself" challenged participants to utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create art in a manner reminiscent of renowned painters like Claude Monet.

The primary goal was to employ GANs to transfer the style of Claude Monet’s artworks to a set of photographs of natural scenes. Participants were required to create a generator model within a GAN algorithm to recreate Monet's distinctive style from a photo, while a discriminator model within the GAN was tasked with distinguishing between real and generated images.


# 2. Technology utilized - CycleGAN

CycleGAN is designed for image-to-image translation tasks without paired training data. Its architecture comprises two generators and two discriminators, forming a cycle-consistent adversarial network.
Unlike traditional GANs, CycleGAN can work with unpaired training data, which means you don't need to have exact correspondences between the style images and content images. This feature could be particularly useful in this competition where obtaining paired data might be challenging.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of its architecture:

**Generators:**

*There are two generators, G and F, in CycleGAN.
*Generator G maps images from domain X to domain Y (G: X → Y), and generator F maps images from domain Y to domain X (F: Y → X).
*They consist of an encoder, a series of residual blocks, and a decoder. The encoder reduces the spatial dimensions of the input image while increasing the depth, the residual blocks help in learning the target representation, and the decoder then upscales this representation to produce an image of the same size as the input.


**Discriminators:**

*Two discriminators, D_X and D_Y, are employed.
*Discriminator D_X distinguishes between real images from domain X and fake images generated by F.
*Discriminator D_Y distinguishes between real images from domain Y and fake images generated by G.
*They are typically constructed as PatchGANs which evaluate the authenticity of images on a patch-by-patch basis, rather than assessing the entire image globally.


**Cycle Consistency Loss:**

A crucial part of the CycleGAN architecture is the cycle consistency loss which enforces a round-trip consistency in the mapping learned by the generators.
It ensures that if an image from domain X is translated to domain Y by G and then translated back to domain X by F, the result should be close to the original image from domain X (and vice versa).


**Adversarial Loss:**

The adversarial loss ensures that the generated images are indistinguishable from real images in the target domain.
